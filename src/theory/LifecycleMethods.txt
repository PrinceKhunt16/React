1 Mounting 
    1 constructor(props)
        - A special function that will get called whenever a new component is created.
        - Initializing state.
        - Binding the event handlers.
        - Do not cuase side effects. (http requests)
        - super(props) directly overwrite this.state

    2 static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
        - When the state of the component depends on changes in props over time.
        - Set the state.
        - Do not cause side effects. (http requests)

    3 render() 
        - Only required method.
        - Read props, state and return JSX.
        - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
        - Children components lifecycle methods are also executed.

    4 componentDidMount()
        - Invoked immediately after a component and all its children components have been renderd to the DOM.
        - Cause side effects. (Interact with the DOM or perform any ajax calls to load data)

2 Updating
    1 static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)
        - Method is called every time a component is re-rendered.
        - Set the state.
        - Do not cause side effects. (http requests)

    2 shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)
        - Dictates if the component should re-rendred or not.
        - Performance optimization.
        - Do not cause side effect. (http requests, calling the setState method)
    
    3 render()
        - Only required method.
        - Read props, state and return JSX.
        - Do not change state or interact with DOM or make ajax calls.
    
    4 getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) 
        - Called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the DOM.
        - Capture some information from the DOM.
        - Method will either return null or return a value.
        - Returned value will be passed as the third parameter to the next method.
    
    5 componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)
        - Called after the render is finished in the re-rendred cycles.
        - Cause side effects.

3 Unmounting     
    1 componentWillUnmount()
        - This method allows us to execute the react code when the component gets destroyed or unmounted from the DOM.
        - This method is called during the unmounting phase of the react life cycle.

4 Error Handling
    1 static getDerivedStateFromError(error)
        - This method is invoked if some error occurs during the rendering phase of any lifecycle methods or any chhildren components.
        - This method is used to implement the error boundaries for the react application.
        - Is is called during the render phase so side effects are not permitted in this method.

    2 componentDidCatch(error, info)
        - This method is invoked if some error occurs during the rendering phase of any lifecycle methods or any children components.
        - This method is used to implement the error boundaries for the react application. 
        - Is is called during the commit phase so unlike getDerivedStateFromError which was called during the render phase so side effects are allowed in thid method.
        - This method is used to log errors.
